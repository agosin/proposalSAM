Objective:
Art installation that will be a challenge for the Museum in terms of preservation.

DESCRIPTION
Installation based on organic materials.
In general terms, the piece installs a natural environment within the museum, with different elements such as plants, irrigation system, sunlight / artificial, air supply and nutrient supply. It would be like a small electronically controlled greenhouse. The idea is to generate a micro sensitive biosystem that its operation (amount of water, soil nutrients and light / artificial) depends on external variables. Specifically of the real-time data of financial speculation 


CHALENGES
1. Preservation of organic material: 
An important part of the piece would be impossible to preserv, because that material should replace in each exhibition. Regarding the organic material, the chalenge would be about the documentation and implemtation to the future exhibitions. Therefore, the preservation of a pice like that is incomplete and depend directly of the documentation.

2. Code issues: This piece depend of the collection of external and online data. In this sense, it would be two problems:
  1. Data codification: internet protocols could change/ the codification of online data could change / website adress could  
  change
  2. Therefore, the probably the coud should update in future exhibitation.
  So, the instructions should be clear regarding how reprogram the code. Maybe in that case, cold work create an user iterface   to edit the possible issues. 
  
 PLAN
 
 FEBRUARY: 
 1. Conceptual memory
 2. research/ and experimentation
 3. Final shematic: determinating materiales, variables, dimenssions, shape, interatcion. 

 MARCH: 
 1. Prototype / fabrication
 2. Documentation/Instructions
 
ISSUES TO DEVELOPE
